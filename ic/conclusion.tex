In this paper, we introduced \textsc{RTR-TFM}: a novel TFM that addresses the incentive misalignment in classic transaction fee mechanisms (TFMs) by introducing a novel routing-based block production rule and a revenue scheme. \ourTFM\ rewards block producers in proportion to their contribution to the propagation of transactions. Such a reward ensures that block producers actively participate in the blockchain network upkeep instead of free-riding on other participating nodes. We also provide a game-theoretic characterization of the underlying game in \ourTFM. We prove that \textsc{RTR-TFM} effectively discourages transaction hoarding, ensures Sybil resistance, and achieves incentive compatibility for both users and block producers under reasonable assumptions.

In addition to demonstrating these properties on the technical level, we also show that \ourTFM addresses the underlying informational problems that create the forms of abstract \textit{goal conflict} that lead rational actors to launch byzantine attacks on \textit{TFMs}, creating a new kind of informational environment more conducive to the implementation of \textit{pareto optimality} as a social choice rule in distributed mechanisms.
